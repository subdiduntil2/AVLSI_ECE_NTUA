# AVLSI_ECE_NTUA
Analog Hardware Implementation of a Low-Power Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for Thyroid Detection. The main code AVSLI_v.13.py implements the following:

1. Software training & validation of the GMM
2. Tuning of electronic parameters for hardware implementation (i.e. electronic mean and variance values)
3. Comparison of software and hardware accuracy metrics

Hardware simulations were done via the Cadence IC Suite software.
